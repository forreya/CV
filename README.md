# Ryan Lai

I'm Ryan- junior developer, bedroom artist and basketball fiend. After a uninspiring 3 years pursuing a Physics degree at UCL, I graduated in the summer of 2022 with the newfound exhilaration of finally being able to steer my life into a new direction. Intrinsically I've always been a hardworking and independent soul fuelled with the unwavering ambition to do great things in life. Being a very 'right-brained' person by nature, completing this highly quantitative degree provided the final facet of the skillset needed for my next pursuit- software engineering. 

Looking to prepare for a career in this avenue, I began studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a developer bootcamp, towards the end of 2022. Having already had plentiful experience in coding from university & personal endeavours, Maker's academy felt like the perfect opportunity to hone my craft and find new environments to thrive in. I'm now looking to play my part in a company that possesess a supportive, yet stimulating and challenging environment and hope to work with others who have the same genuine passion for software development as I do.

## Skills

#### Ability to Work Under Pressure
Despite being constantly overloaded with work during my degree, I always found a way to make the most of the situation by strategising my workload and planning my schedule. Because of these techniques, I tend not to get overwhelmed when put under pressure and instead find methods to overcome the adversities I face by critically analysing the best way to approach the situation.

#### Interpersonal Skills
Having undertaken countless group projects and experiments over the last 5 years, I understand the importance of empathy when it comes to being good team player, especially when working with people who think and approach problems in a different way. At Makers, most of my time involves pair programming & team projects, which will teach me even more invaluable lessons in working efficiently and effectively in groups- especially in a programming setting.

#### Independent Learning
As are many software engineers, I am a very independent individual and am not afraid to dive into something I know little about. This makes me very adaptable and flexible as I am always ready to pick up new ideas and concepts, or even programming languages if needed.

## Other Interests
#### *(If you want to get to know me better)*

#### Making Music
I learnt to produce beats on my laptop many years ago as a fun pastime. As my expertise grew, I decided to start uploading my instrumentals to websites where musical artists can purchase licenses, granting them the rights to profit off songs that use my beats. Soon, I started to garner some sales and to this day I still love producing music in my spare time. I even embarked on a project where I developed my own music licensing website (see projects section).

#### Skating
One reason I fell in love with this sport was because of the genuine relationships that were fostered through skating with strangers who eventually became some of my closest friends. In everyday life, people are often overly concerned with social status, money, image, etc. When skating, all these day-to-day stresses are forgotten, everybody is equal, and you really get to know each other on the most personal level through the struggles & experiences you share. I believe this mindset to be invaluable in all aspects of life, so I always try my best to retain this outlook in every relationship I have.

#### Basketball
I represented my school for basketball and competed in international competitions that taught me how important comradery and communication are for success, especially in a team setting.

#### Photography
I love taking and editing photos of anything and everything. This is my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryan.likes.views/">photography page</a>.
