# Ryan Lai

I'm Ryan- junior developer, bedroom artist and basketball fiend. After a hellish 3 years pursuing a Physics degree at UCL, I graduated in the summer of 2022 with the newfound exhilaration of finally being able to steer my life into a new direction. 

Having always been an intrinsically creative soul with a healthy streak of perfectionism, this highly quantitative degree provided the final facet of the skillset needed for my next goal. Looking to prepare for a career in full stack software development, I began studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a developer bootcamp, towards the end of 2021. Having already had plentiful experience in coding from university & personal endeavours, Maker's academy felt like the perfect opportunity to hone my craft and find new environments to thrive in. 

I'm now looking to play my part in a company that possesess a supportive, yet stimulating and challenging environment and hope to work with others who have the same genuine passion for software development as I do.
