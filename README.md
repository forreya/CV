# Ryan Lai

I'm Ryan- junior developer, bedroom artist and basketball fiend. After a uninspiring 3 years pursuing a Physics degree at UCL, I graduated in the summer of 2022 with the newfound exhilaration of finally being able to steer my life into a new direction. Intrinsically I've always been a hardworking and independent soul fuelled with the unwavering ambition to do great things in life. Being a very 'right-brained' person by nature, completing this highly quantitative degree provided the final facet of the skillset needed for my next pursuit- software engineering. 

Looking to prepare for a career in this avenue, I began studying at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, a developer bootcamp, towards the end of 2022. Having already had plentiful experience in coding from university & personal endeavours, Maker's academy felt like the perfect opportunity to hone my craft and find new environments to thrive in. I'm now looking to play my part in a company that possesess a supportive, yet stimulating and challenging environment and hope to work with others who have the same genuine passion for software development as I do.

## Skills

#### Ability to Work Under Pressure
Despite being constantly overloaded with work during my degree, I always found a way to make the most of the situation by strategising my workload and planning my schedule. Because of these techniques, I tend not to get overwhelmed when put under pressure and instead find methods to overcome the adversities I face by critically analysing the best way to approach the situation.

#### Interpersonal Skills
Having undertaken countless group projects and experiments over the last 5 years, I understand the importance of empathy when it comes to being good team player, especially when working with people who think and approach problems in a different way. At Makers, most of my time involves pair programming & team projects, which will teach me even more invaluable lessons in working efficiently and effectively in groups- especially in a programming setting.

#### Independent Learning
As are many software engineers, I am a very independent individual and am not afraid to dive into something I know little about. This makes me very adaptable and flexible as I am always ready to pick up new ideas and concepts, or even programming languages if needed.
